#Reddit Fetcher NTP

A chrome extension that changes the newtab page into a live stream of images from selected subreddits.

##How to install

1. Go to the extensions page.
2. Turn on dev mode with the checkbox.
3. Clone this repository locally.
4. Click load unpacked extension.
5. Select the folder that you cloned into.
6. Done!

If I ever get the $5 to make a chrome store dev account, I'll put it on there and it can then be installed like any other extension.

##How to change the settings

Go to the chrome extensions page and click options.

You can change the subreddit, sorting method, and zooming method.

**Note:** You can select multiple subreddits by concatenating with `+`'s like: `movies+pics`.
